# 0x13 - JavaScript: Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains JavaScript solutions to various tasks related to objects, scopes, and closures.

## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0
- Create an empty `Rectangle` class using class notation.

### 1. Rectangle #1
- Define a `Rectangle` class with a constructor that accepts width (`w`) and height (`h`) as arguments.

### 2. Rectangle #2
- Define a `Rectangle` class that initializes `width` and `height` attributes and creates an empty object if either attribute is 0 or not a positive integer.

### 3. Rectangle #3
- Add a `print()` method to the `Rectangle` class that prints a rectangle using the character `X`.

### 4. Rectangle #4
- Extend the `Rectangle` class with a `rotate()` method that swaps the width and height, and a `double()` method that doubles the width and height.

### 5. Square #0
- Create a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class and takes one argument (`size`) as the constructor. Use `super()` to call the `Rectangle` constructor.

### 6. Square #1
- Add a `charPrint(c)` method to the `Square` class to print the square using a specified character. If no character is provided, default to `X`.

### 7. Occurrences
- Write a function that counts the occurrences of a specified element in a list.

### 8. Esrever
- Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.

### 9. Log me
- Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### 10. Number conversion
- Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

### 11. Factor index
- Write a script that imports an array and computes a new array where each element is the product of the original element and its index.

### 12. Sorted occurrences
- Write a script that computes a dictionary of user IDs by occurrences.

## Requirements
- JavaScript ES6 or later
- Node.js (for running and testing the scripts)

## Usage
To run any script, execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
node <script_name>.js
