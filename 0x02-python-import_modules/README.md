# Python - Import & Modules

This project focuses on Python imports and modules. It contains a series of tasks designed to help you understand and practice using imports, creating modules, and working with command line arguments in Python.

## Project Information

- All Python scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code uses pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
- File: `0-add.py`
- Description: Imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

### 1. My first toolbox!
- File: `1-calculation.py`
- Description: Imports functions from `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result

### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
- File: `2-args.py`
- Description: Prints the number of and the list of its arguments

### 3. Infinite addition
- File: `3-infinite_add.py`
- Description: Prints the result of the addition of all arguments

### 4. Who are you?
- File: `4-hidden_discovery.py`
- Description: Prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`

### 5. Everything can be imported
- File: `5-variable_load.py`
- Description: Imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value

### 6. Build my own calculator!
- File: `100-my_calculator.py`
- Description: Imports all functions from `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations

### 7. Easy print
- File: `101-easy_print.py`
- Description: Prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output

### 8. ByteCode -> Python #3
- File: `102-magic_calculation.py`
- Description: Python function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode

### 9. Fast alphabet
- File: `103-fast_alphabet.py`
- Description: Prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line

## Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, use the following command:
./script_name.py
For example:
./0-add.py
Make sure to give execution permissions to the scripts:
chmod +x *.py
