# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers fundamental concepts in Python programming, including conditional statements, loops, and functions. It's part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- The importance of indentation in Python
- How to use the `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How Python's `for` loop differs from C's
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- The purpose of the `pass` statement and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- Functions and how to use them
- What happens when a function doesn't use a `return` statement
- Variable scope
- What a traceback is
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them
